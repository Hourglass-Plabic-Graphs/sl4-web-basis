# Growth Rule Verifications

In this repository we provide Python code to verify various claims made in Section 5 of

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [GPPSS] *Rotation-invariant web bases from hourglass plabic graphs* ([arXiv: 2306.12501](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12501))

by Christian Gaetz, Oliver Pechenik, Stephan Pfannerer, Jessica Striker, and Joshua P. Swanson.

1. Plumbings, appliances, and crystal appliances are implemented
2. The explicit calculations in [GPPSS], Example 5.19 are checked.
3. The 88 short rules and several of the long rules in [GPPSS], Figure 24 are verified to be good degenerations, completing the proof of Theorem 5.25.
4. The additional good degenerations in [GPPSS], Lemma 5.22 are verified, completing its proof.
5. Finitely many of the additional good degenerations in [GPPSS], Lemma 5.24(iv) are checked.
6. The claim in [GPPSS], Lemma 5.26 is verified, completing its proof.
7. The additional crystal appliance constraints for the relevant short rules in [GPPSS], Lemma 5.44 and Lemma 5.48 are verified, completing their proofs.
8. The lex conditions in [GPPSS], Lemma 5.31 are verified, completing its proof, along with the claimed converse in Remark 5.32.
